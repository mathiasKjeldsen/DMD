  <br> Handify is created by Bj√∏rn Skalkam, Mathias Kjeldsen, Josef Jensen and Alexander Larsen as a school project for Aalborg
  University on the second semester of medialogy.
  <br>
  <br>The aim of the application is to lighten the load on parents with handicapped children. Any family could potentially
  use it, but we are focusing on these families. The idea is that instead of having the parents (aka. coordinators) spending
  all of their time on the coordination, the helpers can log what they do themselves, and then the parents would only have
  to verify that it's true. We hope this can lead to a bit of stress relief in the daily life of a parent with a handicapped
  child.
  <br>
  <br> Handify is a progressive wep app created in Ionic 3 with Firebase 4 as database.
